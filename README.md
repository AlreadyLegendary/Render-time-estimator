# Render-time-estimator
this is a addon for blender that estimates the total render time for the whole animation it can also play a sound after each frame or at the end of the animation
it can play a self-chosen sound file, or you can just use the sound given in this project

if you want to use the sound in this project, you have to unzip it and take the waw-file out and then rezip it!
If you don't like my sounds, :( you can just download or use a sound yourself, blender can handle almost every format!

to acctually use it, you have to copy the path in the explorer and REPLACE THE \ WITH /!
