# Render-time-estimator
this is a addon for blender that estimates the total render time for the whole animation it can also play a sound after each frame or at the end of the animation
it can play a self-chosen sound file, or you can just use the sound given in this project

output:

to get here, you need to click window/toggle system console. there will be the output after each frame

if you want to use the sound in this project, you have to unzip it and take the waw-file out and then rezip it!
If you don't like my sounds, :( you can just download or use a sound yourself, blender can handle almost every format!

to acctually use it, you have to copy the path in the explorer and REPLACE THE \ WITH /!
